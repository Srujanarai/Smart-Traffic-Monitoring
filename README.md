Smart Traffic Monitoring is developed using Python, incorporating the YOLOv8
deep learning model for object detection and the OpenCV library for video
processing and visualization. The system is designed to detect, classify, and
count various vehicle types such as cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks from a
video feed or live camera stream. The methodology includes structured modules
for loading the model, processing video input, performing detection, and
rendering the results.
